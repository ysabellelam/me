								<p>After my first year of college, I decided that I should spend my time at UCSD learning more than whats taught in class. Specifically, expanding outside of the Mechnaical Engineering department. Becuase of this, I love attending hackathons and working on multidisciplinary projects that teach me skills from all disciplines of engineering and help me gain experience as a project and team leader.</p>

									HackeTech 2019 <br>
									In a team of three, created two robotic cars that are controllable through an Android application. Utilizing this app, the user can maneuver their tank in addition to position their laser in an attempt to hit their opponent. When their opponent is hit in their critical spot, their LED flashes off, indicating that they have been shot. Players can then decide on their own how many shots are required to conclude the game.
